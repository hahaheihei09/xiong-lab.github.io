### Overview
Our laser weeding technology offers an effective alternative to traditional chemical and mechanical methods. By leveraging advanced error compensation trajectories and optimal parameter combinations, we achieve precise and efficient weed removal.

### Key Features
- **Error Compensation Trajectories:** Horizontal, zigzag, triangular, and vertical patterns.
- **Laser Spot Adjustment:** Spot diameter adjustable between 1-4 mm.
- **Optimal Parameters:** Maximum laser power, 80° incidence angle, and 2 mm spot diameter.

### Impact
This technology reduces reliance on chemical herbicides and promotes sustainable farming practices.
