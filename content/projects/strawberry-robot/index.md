### Overview
Our **Strawberry Harvesting Robot** is a fully autonomous system designed to address labor shortages and improve efficiency in strawberry farming. Equipped with advanced AI vision and a patented low-damage gripper, it identifies and harvests ripe strawberries with precision and care.

### Key Features
- **AI Vision System:** An end-to-end strawberry maturity measurement algorithm that overcomes lighting variations and achieves precise fruit recognition using multi-view fusion.
- **Low-Damage Gripper:** A patented gripper ensures gentle handling, minimizing damage to the fruit.
- **LingXtend Arm:** The hybrid arm offers an operational space 3 times that of the UR3 serial arm and 14 times that of the IRB360 parallel arm, enabling obstacle avoidance in greenhouse environments.
- **Online Grading:** Online grading by weight and maturity during harvesting, eliminating the need for post-harvest sorting.
- **Obsctale Separation:** A deep reinforcement learning-based obstacle-clearing algorithm that improves picking performance in dense clusters.

### Impact
This robot reduces reliance on manual labor, lowers harvesting costs, and ensures high-quality strawberries for consumers. It is particularly beneficial for large-scale strawberry farms facing labor shortages.
