### Overview
Our **Strawberry Harvesting Robot** is a fully autonomous system designed to address labor shortages and improve efficiency in strawberry farming. Equipped with advanced AI vision and a patented low-damage gripper, it identifies and harvests ripe strawberries with precision and care.

### Key Features
- **AI Vision System:** Uses computer vision to detect ripe strawberries and assess their quality.
- **Low-Damage Gripper:** A patented gripper ensures gentle handling, minimizing damage to the fruit.
- **Autonomous Navigation:** Moves seamlessly through strawberry rows, avoiding obstacles and optimizing harvesting paths.
- **High Efficiency:** Capable of harvesting strawberries at a speed comparable to human workers, with consistent quality.

### Impact
This robot reduces reliance on manual labor, lowers harvesting costs, and ensures high-quality strawberries for consumers. It is particularly beneficial for large-scale strawberry farms facing labor shortages.
