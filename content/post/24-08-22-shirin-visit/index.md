During her visit, Dr. Ghatrehsamani delivered a presentation on the work of the Precision Agriculture Research Group at Penn State University. She highlighted their research on robotic thinning, fruit harvesting, and the detection and treatment of crop diseases. Dr. Ghatrehsamani also provided insights into the future of robotic crop management, sparking in-depth discussions with Nercita researchers on key challenges such as the dynamic nature of orchard environments, obstacle handling, and the assessment of fruit damage.

Prior to the presentation, Dr. Ghatrehsamani was given a tour of the SHA Robotics laboratory, the Agricultural Robotics Laboratory, and the exhibition hall focused on agricultural information technology and intelligent equipment. These tours led to further discussions about the challenges in developing fruit and vegetable harvesting robots. Dr. Ghatrehsamani expressed regard for the progress Nercita has made in agricultural robotics and both parties agreed to pursue closer collaboration in future research and student training.
