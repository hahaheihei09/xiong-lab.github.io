We are pleased to announce that the paper ***"Online Estimation of Table-Top Grown Strawberry Mass in Field Conditions with Occlusions"***, led by **Master's student Jinshan Zhen**, has been accepted for presentation at **IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)**. This work addresses a critical challenge in precision agriculture: accurate fruit mass estimation under occlusion scenarios for robotics harvesting.

### Technical Abstract
> *"Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations. This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep learning to enable non-destructive, real-time mass estimation. The method employs YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, CycleGAN for occluded region completion, and tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A polynomial regression model maps geometric features to mass, demonstrating superior performance in occluded scenarios compared to traditional methods."*

### Significance
This work enables:
- **Harvesting robot online grading** through real-time mass feedback
- **Generalizable framework** for other occluded fruit estimation tasks

**Congratulations to Jinshan Zhen and the team!** ðŸŽ‰ We look forward to presenting at IROS 2025 in Hangzhou.
