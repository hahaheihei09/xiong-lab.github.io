A paper led by master student **Nengwei Yang**, titled "PHDT-DETR: A Lightweight End-to-End Detector for On-Device Truss Tomato Detection in Greenhouses," has been published in **Smart Agricultural Technology**.

The study proposes the **PHDT-DETR**, a streamlined detection model that maintains accuracy while being efficient enough to run in real-time on **embedded devices** within greenhouses, facilitating scalable robotic scouting and harvesting.

Congratulations to the authors!
