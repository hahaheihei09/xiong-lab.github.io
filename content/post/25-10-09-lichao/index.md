A paper led by PhD student **Lichao Yang**, titled "High-Tolerance Soft-Rigid Gripper for Low-Damage Robotic Strawberry Harvesting," has been published in the prestigious journal **IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)**.

The paper presents a novel **hybrid soft-rigid gripper** design. Its structure adapts to fruit shape, tolerates positioning errors, and achieves **very low damage rates**, marking a significant advancement for reliable harvesting end-effectors.

Congratulations to the authors!
