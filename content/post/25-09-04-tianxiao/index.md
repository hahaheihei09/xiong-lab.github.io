A paper led by PhD student **Tianxiao Zhu**, titled "Five-degree-of-freedom strawberry pose estimation using key points and oriented bounding box detection," has been published in **Computers and Electronics in Agriculture**.

This work enables **5-Degree-of-Freedom (5-DOF) pose estimation** for strawberries by detecting key points and oriented boxes. Determining the fruit's exact position and orientation is a critical step for planning damage-free robotic grasps.

Congratulations to the authors!
