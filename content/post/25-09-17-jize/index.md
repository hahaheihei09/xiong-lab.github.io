From September 15-16, 2025, the **"2025 Pepper Industry (Jize) High-Quality Development Conference"** was successfully held in Handan, Hebei Province. The conference served as a key platform for industry exchange, focusing on the standardization and brand development of the pepper industry.

During the event, attendees observed demonstrations of a full suite of agricultural robots independently developed by **S-H Robotics**, including models for **laser weeding, inspection, pollination, and harvesting**. The conference also marked the launch of a new collaborative R&D project between our lab and Tianye Company, aimed at developing a **field transport robot**.
