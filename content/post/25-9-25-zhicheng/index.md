A paper led by **Zhicheng Hu**, titled "Strawberry bruise susceptibility analysis based on discrete element method coupled with finite element simulation," has been accepted for publication in **Postharvest Biology and Technology**.

This research combines **Discrete Element Method (DEM)** and **Finite Element (FE) simulation** to create a detailed model predicting bruise damage during robotic handling. The work provides crucial data for designing gentler robotic grippers to minimize fruit loss.

Congratulations to the authors!
