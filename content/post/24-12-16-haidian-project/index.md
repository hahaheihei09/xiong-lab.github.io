### Demonstration Highlights
The review panel visited two key demonstration sites to observe project outcomes:

- **Cuihu Smart Agriculture Innovation Factory (Phase II):**  
  In the research greenhouse, the **spraying robot** and **pollination robot** efficiently navigated among lush tomato plants, autonomously performing tasks without any human intervention. Their flexible operations showcased the advancements in automation for greenhouse agriculture.
  
- **Zhongguancun Science Popularization Farm - “5G Strawberry Garden”:**  
  The **strawberry harvesting robot**, equipped with a self-developed low-damage gripper and vision-based measurement algorithm, seamlessly moved under strawberry racks. The robot identified and picked ripe strawberries, offering a practical solution to seasonal labor shortages and rising costs in elevated strawberry farming.

### Expert Feedback
The on-site demonstrations vividly showcased the robots’ capabilities, earning high praise from the expert panel for their practical applications. Following the field visit, the review team attended a detailed presentation covering project implementation, research achievements, and budget utilization. The experts engaged in a thorough discussion and unanimously approved the completion of the first phase of Haidian District’s **Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Projects**.

### Conclusion
The successful acceptance of these projects marks a significant milestone for S-H Robotics Lab. By addressing critical challenges such as labor shortages and operational efficiency, these projects represent an important step toward sustainable and intelligent farming solutions.
