We are excited to announce that a paper by **Mr. Huayan Hu**, our master student, has been accepted by **IEEE Transactions on AgriFood Electronics**. Automatic targeting of weeds using lasers often encounters positional errors, particularly in dynamic weeding modes. The paper examines the positional error and weeding effect challenges in laser weeding, offering innovative solutions for precision and efficiency in laser weeding. [Read the highlights below.](#highlights)

### Highlights
- **Error Compensation Trajectories:** Four weeding patterns were tested, with the **horizontal trajectory** proving most effective for reducing positional errors.
- **Laser Spot Adjustment:** A device was designed to adjust spot diameter (1-4 mm), optimizing weeding efficiency.
- **Optimal Parameters:** The best combinationâ€”**horizontal pattern**, **maximum laser power**, **80Â° incidence angle**, and **2 mm spot diameter**â€”achieved position errors under **2 mm**.
- **Validation Results:** Average cutting times for **Chenopodium album**, **Polygonum hydropiper**, **Setaria viridis**, and **Eleusine indica** were **0.411s**, **0.308s**, **0.419s**, and **0.384s**, respectively.


**Congratulations to Mr. Huayan Hu on this outstanding achievement!** ðŸŒ±ðŸ”¬
