A paper led by PhD student **Meili Sun**, titled "Light-resilient visual regression of strawberry ripeness for robotic harvesting," has been accepted for publication in **Computers and Electronics in Agriculture**.

The research introduces a **robust visual regression model** that maintains high accuracy in judging strawberry ripeness under varying greenhouse light conditions. This technology is key for enabling consistent, selective harvesting by robots.

Congratulations to the authors!
