A paper led by PhD student **Shimin Hu**, titled "Calibration-enhanced multi-view RGB-D vision for robust recognition and 3D localization of strawberries under occlusions," has been accepted by **Computers and Electronics in Agriculture**.

The study presents a **calibration-enhanced algorithm** that fuses data from multiple cameras. This system significantly improves fruit recognition and precise 3D localization in dense, occluded environments, enabling more reliable robotic harvesting.

Congratulations to the authors!
