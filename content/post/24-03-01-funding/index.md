We are pleased to announce that our lab has been awarded funding for two new projects by the Haidian District Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. These grants will support our ongoing efforts to advance agricultural robotics and integrate innovative technologies into modern farming practices.

The first project, titled "Integration of Agricultural Robotics and Agronomy for Hands-Free Strawberry Harvesting," is led by Dr. Ya Xiong. This project focuses on integrating and demonstrating hands-free strawberry harvesting technology by combining agricultural robotics and agronomy. The project has received a grant of 2 million CNY for 2024, with a potential extension of an additional 4 million CNY over the next two years.

The second project, titled "Robotic Operation System for Protected Horticulture," is led by Dr. Sen Lin. This project aims to develop a robotic operation system, including robotic spraying and pollination for greenhouse tomatoes. It has been granted 2.5 million CNY for 2024, with a possible extension of 2 million CNY in 2025.

These projects represent a significant step forward in our mission to revolutionize agriculture through the development and application of cutting-edge robotics. We are excited to embark on these initiatives and look forward to sharing our progress in the coming months.
