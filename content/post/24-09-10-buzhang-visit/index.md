On September 10, 2024, Minister Han Jun and a delegation from the Ministry of Agriculture visited Nercita to examine the latest innovations in agricultural robotics. During the visit, the S-H Robotics team had the honor of demoing HarvestFlex, our newly developed strawberry-picking robot, to the visiting leadership.
