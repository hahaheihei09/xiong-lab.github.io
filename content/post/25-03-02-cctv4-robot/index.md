### Innovation Highlights
The fully autonomous robot, **independently designed and patented** by the S-H Robotics Lab, integrates AI and advanced engineering to address labor shortages and improve efficiency in strawberry farming. Some features include:

- **Rigid-Flexible Coupling Harvesting Gripper:**  
  Reduces picking damage to **3%**, matching manual harvesting precision, while offering superior error tolerance for varied fruit conditions.

- **LingXtend 1 Robotic Arm:**  
  Performs complex motions like **"splitting," "bending,"** obstacle avoidance, and mobile grasping, enabling **dual-arm continuous harvesting** in dense crop environments.

- **FieldRover Mobile Platform:**  
  Achieves **four-wheel differential steering**, **on-the-spot turning**, **diagonal walking**, and **precision speed control**. Adjustable wheelbase and axle distance ensure adaptability to diverse field layouts.

### Looking Ahead
As the lab continues to refine its designs, these advancements promise to empower farmers, reduce costs, and pave the way for a **smarter, more sustainable agricultural future**.
