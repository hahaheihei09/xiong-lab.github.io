Ya (Bill) Xiong is a research professor at the National Engineering Research Center for Information Technology in Agriculture (Nercita) at the Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences. He earned his PhD from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) in 2019 and subsequently worked as a postdoctoral researcher and robotics engineer at NMBU and Saga Robotics, respectively. During his time at NMBU, he focused on designing, developing, and integrating strawberry-harvesting robots and sampling robots in the Robotics Control Group under the supervision of Prof. PÃ¥l Johan From.

Over the past seven years, he has successfully developed a laser weeding robot under the supervision of Prof. Simon Blackmore, a world-leading strawberry-harvesting robot from scratch, and a sampling robot. His work, spanning from hardware to software, included gripper design, arm development, vision system development, picking path planning, manipulation control, system integration, and evaluation. In 2022. the strawberry harvester was fully automated, capable of continuously picking and collecting dozens of punnets of berries without interruption using two arms simultaneously.

In 2023, Ya Xiong left Norway to begin his professorship at Nercita, where he is currently working on the development of a new generation of strawberry-harvesting robots and laser weeding robots, aiming to be a pioneer in making agricultural robots available to farmers.
